      <b class="article-subheader">Three Essential Elements for Operating an English School</b><br>  
      VISION UP was developed based on the success of the after-school English immersion program, Kids UP, to provide like-minded businesses with all the tools and knowledge needed to run a high-quality educational service. With extensive experience in Japan’s English conversation school industry, we have dedicated ourselves to creating a refined English learning environment that equips children with practical and usable English skills.<br>
      <br>
      Our goal is twofold: to immerse children in an English-speaking environment similar to studying abroad for extended periods and to provide a reliable after-school care solution for working parents. Our vision for school operations is based on the following three core principles:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Instilling Resilience and Growth in Children:</b><br>
      We believe in fostering a spirit of challenge and perseverance in children. Our curriculum is designed to spark curiosity, cultivate a love for learning, and build confidence and adaptability—essential qualities for tackling future challenges and achieving success.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Providing the Best Possible English Education:</b><br>
      We recognize the importance of early childhood education and focus on maximizing children’s potential during these formative years. By using an experiential learning approach, we ensure that children not only learn English but also develop the ability to think and communicate naturally in English.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Building a Passionate and Dedicated Teaching Team:</b><br>
      Our team is composed of highly dedicated professionals who are committed to continuous personal and professional growth. By fostering a workplace culture that encourages challenges and innovation, our staff continuously enhance their skills, contributing to the overall success of the organization.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b class="article-subheader">A Story of Remarkable Growth</b><br>  
      Our journey began in 2016 with the opening of our first school in Den-en-chofu Yukigaya. Since then, we have steadily expanded, opening 2 to 3 new schools annually. As of 2025, we operate 36 schools across Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama, with 5,257 enrolled students and a team of over 500 staff members. We remain committed to delivering high-quality English education and supporting children's language development.

      <b class="article-subheader">A Robust Business Model</b><br>
      In 2023, Kids UP surpassed 2 billion yen in revenue, solidifying its position as the leader in the after-school English immersion industry. However, our journey was not without challenges. In 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide, we faced the difficult decision of temporarily closing all our schools for two months. Despite the widespread uncertainty and restrictions that followed, we opened two new schools by the end of that same year, demonstrating the resilience of our business model even in the midst of a global crisis.<br>
      <br>
      While Kids UP remains committed to fundamental business principles, we continuously refine our methods to adapt to changing times. As the company has expanded, we have proactively recruited professionals with diverse skills and expertise while developing a unique curriculum to enhance English learning. <br>
      <br>
      At VISION UP, our proprietary curriculum not only strengthens students' English proficiency but also supports on-site staff by enabling them to deliver lessons quickly and efficiently. At the same time, we provide training programs and teaching materials to ensure that our partner companies can seamlessly implement our educational services.
