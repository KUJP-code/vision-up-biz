        At VISION UP, we provide comprehensive training programs designed to empower your team and drive the success of your educational venture, whether you're launching a new school or expanding an existing one. We are committed to meticulous preparation and a robust support system to ensure that every member of your team grows and thrives.<br>
      <br>
      <b class="article-subheader">Staff Development</b><br>
<br>
<b>Managers:</b>
<br>
Aspiring managers undergo training to acquire the essential skills for daily operations management, new customer acquisition, and effective staff management. This equips them with the capabilities to lead and manage their teams from day one.<br>
<br>
<b>Native (Foreign) Instructors:</b> <br>
We provide training on teaching methodologies, including phonics, classroom management, child safety, promotional activities, and parent communication. This empowers native instructors to excel as professional educators.<br>
<br>
<b>Bilingual Instructors:</b><br>
In addition to the native instructor training, bilingual instructors receive further training to address the diverse needs of Japanese students and parents. This includes in-depth parent communication, student support, and bus operations.<br>
<br>
<b>Part-Time Staff:</b><br>
We provide the necessary skills and knowledge for safely escorting children during bus operations, ensuring the smooth and efficient running of the school.<br>
 <br>
 VISION UP offers specialized training tailored to the needs of each role within your educational institution, fostering a team of competent and dedicated individuals who contribute to the school's success and growth.

      <p>
        <b class="article-subheader">Ongoing Development:</b><br>
        <br>
        Our commitment to training extends beyond the onboarding phase. We provide regular training opportunities for continuous improvement. For example, we conduct regular workshops for instructors, both in-person and online, to maintain high educational standards and update teaching skills. This ongoing approach fosters continuous professional development.<br>
        <br>
        Our consultants also conduct on-site school visits to analyze operational situations and provide improvement suggestions. While online analysis of school management is possible, on-site visits allow for more practical and tailored consulting.<br>
        <br>        
        To ensure instructors maintain high-quality teaching, our instructor trainers visit schools to evaluate teaching and classroom management skills. Through regular feedback, we aim to further enhance instructors' abilities.
      </p>


      <img src="/includes/images/training/training-3.webp" alt="" class="generic-image-right">
      <p>
        In addition to the above, we offer training programs focused on advanced topics such as effective methods for improving children's English proficiency and strategic methods for enhancing customer retention. These programs deepen instructors' specialized knowledge, enabling them to deliver engaging lessons that motivate students.<br>
        <br>
        We also provide training programs for instructor trainers, supporting the development of trainers within your organization. Through customized training and workshops, we help trainers enhance their skills and become effective leaders.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, our online training programs incorporate support systems to address any questions clients may have. We conduct monthly online meetings for follow-up purposes, ensuring timely support.<br>
        <br>
        VISION UP's training services are designed to support all aspects of your educational business, from human resource development to management consulting. Our goal is to help you create an educational environment of the highest quality.
