        <b class="article-subheader">Our Curriculum</b><br>
       At VISION UP, we believe that learning English as a second language is most effective when it's enjoyable. Our comprehensive curriculum is meticulously designed to meet the needs of both parents and children, providing a safe and nurturing environment where children can develop a lifelong love of English. We understand that parents want the best for their children – a place where they feel secure and supported, while also receiving a high-quality education that prepares them for the future.  That's why our curriculum goes beyond simply teaching grammar and vocabulary.  We focus on creating a fun, interactive, and engaging learning experience that sparks children's curiosity and motivates them to explore the world of English. We believe that by fostering a love of learning, we empower children to become confident communicators and lifelong English speakers.

        <b class="article-subheader">Learn with Fun</b><br>
        Guided by the principle of "Learn with Fun," we incorporate Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) to create exciting and engaging educational experiences. Developed in collaboration with Professor Tadatoshi Kaya, a leading applied linguist specializing in early English education, our curriculum ensures the highest quality of English language instruction. <br>
        Our "Learn with Fun" methodology includes:<br>
        <br>
        <b>- Colorful Textbooks and Materials:</b> Designed to make learning playful and engaging.<br>
        <br>
        <b>- Challenges and Competition:</b> Encourages healthy competition and a sense of accomplishment, fostering personal growth.<br>
        <br>
        <b>- Active Learning:</b>  Incorporates physical activities and movement to make learning a dynamic and enjoyable experience.<br>
        <br>
        These approaches help children overcome any hesitation or difficulties they may have with speaking English, building their confidence and fluency. Through captivating activities, students naturally acquire English skills and develop a positive attitude towards language learning.
      </p>

        <b class="article-subheader">Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL):</b><br>
        CLIL combines subject-based learning with practical English skills. Our CLIL approach enhances language acquisition by teaching various subjects in English:<br>
        <br>
        <b>- Science & Crafts:</b> Hands-on experiments and creative projects help children learn English in a practical, engaging way.<br>
        <br>
        <b>- Dance & Exercise:</b> Dynamically teaches essential vocabulary and verbs through physical movement.<br>
        <br>
        <b>- Cognitive Development:</b> Enhances English proficiency and critical thinking skills, fostering problem-solving abilities.<br>
        <br>
        These activities not only develop practical English skills but also broaden knowledge across various subjects. By catering to individual interests, we motivate students and equip them with the language skills necessary for natural communication.
        <br>

        <b class="article-subheader">Building a Strong Linguistic Foundation</b><br>

        Mastering grammar is crucial for language proficiency. Through systematic practice, we ensure that children not only enjoy learning English but also develop a solid understanding of grammatical structures.<br>
        <br>
        <b>- CEFR-Based Learning:</b> We align our curriculum with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) guidelines for grammar and language proficiency.<br>
        <br>
        <b>- Level-Appropriate Curriculum:</b> Students learn grammar and vocabulary tailored to their specific level.<br>
        <br>
        <b>- Balanced Skill Development:</b> Focuses on developing all four language skills: reading, writing, speaking, and listening.<br>
        <br>
        <b>- Repetitive Learning:</b> Employs various methods of repetition to ensure long-term retention.<br>
        <br>
        <b>- Phonics Integration:</b> Starting with fundamental phonics, students gradually develop reading comprehension skills.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="p-sub">Note: CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) is an international standard for measuring foreign language proficiency, providing a common framework across different languages and countries.</span>
